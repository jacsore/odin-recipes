           <h2>Braised Corned Beef</h2>
                <p>Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®), or as desired</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours.</li>
               
            </ol>
