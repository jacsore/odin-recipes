           <h2>Slow Cooker Corned Beef</h2>
                <p>Skip the stove top boil and the oven roast; the slow cooker does all the work here and makes the corned beef fall-apart tender. All you need is some Irish soda bread to serve alongside. </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ pound baby carrots                </li>
                <li>½ pound small yellow potatoes (such as Dutch Yellow® Pee Wee potatoes)                </li>
                <li>1 sweet onion, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>4¾ pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons onion powder</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)</li>
                <li>1 medium head cabbage, quartered and leaves separated</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place corned beef in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add spice packet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corned beef is just about fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>While the corned beef is simmering, cut potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 3-inch pieces. Cut cabbage into small wedges.</li>
                <li>When corned beef has cooked for 2 hours, add potatoes and carrots; cook until vegetables are almost tender and meat is fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until tender, about 15 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove meat and let rest for 15 minutes. Leave broth and vegetables in the Dutch oven.</li>
                <li>Slice meat across the grain. Serve with vegetables and broth.</li>
            </ol>
